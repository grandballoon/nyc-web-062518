# Inheritance and the prototype chain

Code associated to inheritance and the prototype chain

## Outline

* Explore a world without behavior/data sharing
* Answer (**Why?**)
  * Why is inheritance/sharing useful?
  * What are we sharing?
* **How it works?**
  * `JS`'s and `Ruby`'s inheritance model similarities and differences
  * Understand the `Prototype Chain`
  * Create objects using `new` and `Constructor` functions
  * *Assignment*: Build your own object
  * `new` vs Object.create
* **How we will likely use it?**
  * Classes (syntactic sugar on the `prototype chain` )
  * Refactor constructor to adopt the class syntax
